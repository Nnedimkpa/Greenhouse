# Greenhouse

Project built to control a microcontroller present in a greenhouse.

Greenhouse can be controlled via Firebase or Bluetooth.

The microcontroller uses this node app(https://github.com/tobydigz/greenhouse_node) to receive data from Firebase.

The app also shows data from ThingSpeak and plots it in a graph using this chart library(https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart)

Bluetooth control is achieved using this bluetooth library(https://github.com/akexorcist/Android-BluetoothSPPLibrary)
